  RuCaptcha's cache_store requirements are stored across processes and machines,
  such as :mem_cache_store, :redis_store, or other distributed storage.
  But your current set is null_store, it has changed to :file_store for working.
  NOTE: :file_store is still not a good way, it only works with single server case.

  Please make config file `config/initializes/rucaptcha.rb` to setup `cache_store`.
  More infomation please read GitHub RuCaptcha README file.
